                <h2>Our Empty Pockets </h2>
                
        
                <p>One of the problems with Common Core education is lack of financial education in middle and high schools. 
Only 17 states require High School students to take a class in personal finance and only 20 states require taking a class in economics to graduate.
 That situation leads to poor money habits among Young Adults and Millennials and can affect next generations too. Many Americans continue to lack even a basic understanding of economic and financial concepts.
<a href=”http://councilforeconed.org/policy-and-advocacy/survey-of-the-states/“></a> </p>



<P>According to a recent survey on millennials,
    <ul>
    <li>   More than half of them are living paycheck to paycheck and dont have an opportunity to save</li>
    <li>    43% of them use costly non-bank borrowing methods such as payday loans, pawn shops and rent-to-own stores</li>
    <li>    75% of nowadays college students carrying credit are unaware of late fees</li>
    <li>    4 in 10 millennials say they are overwhelmed with debt</li>
    <li>  Nearly 1 in 4 adults admit not paying their bills on time</li>

<h2>Solutions and Advocacy</h2>
<p>Study of students who have taken financial classes show the opposite statistics: 
state education affects later life financial decisions in a good way as students are:
    <ul>
        <li> more likely to save</li>
        <li> more likely to pay off credit cards in full each month</li>
        <li> less likely to be compulsive buyers</li>
        <li> more likely to take reasonable financial risk</li>
        <li> have higher credit scores  and lower probability of delinquency as young adults</li>
    </ul>

<p>So as we can see there is hope for improvement in the future if we work to make economic and financial education a priority in our schools.</br>
To do that we need to make sure to advocate for the change spreading information throughout our community and using this helpful Advocacy Plan on Economics and Personal Finance Education. There are many approaches to advocacy planning, but here is a 10-step process that will help assure success.</p>

                <h1>Health Education</h1>
                <p>	Within a nation of increasing obesity rates, it would be logical of the school system to teach and implement programs that help students make a healthier diet choice and a more active life style. Although since the adoption of the Common core into our school systems, there has been a dramatic raise in poor grades, which are causing poor teaching choices. The common core has failed helping the students achieve academic success, and teaching them to understand nutrition; it has only left an increasing obesity rate that has nearly doubled within a single generation.</p>
	
<p>	There is a lack of mandatory since the implementation of the common core. Failing test grades are creating an environment where schools systems want a rigorous study session throughout the day. 23 schools around the country are already reducing P.E. and recess or eliminating it in general. Obesity now affects 17% of children and adolescent. 17% of the children and adolescents are minorities, whom also have the highest risk for failure. Due to the high risk of failure rates, schools often end up comparing students by mandatory test, which end up being link to the pay or job level of the teachers.</p>

<p>	We live in a nation where test grades are literally more of a focus than subject that are literally a matter of life and death. Children with obesity will suffer from various diseases in the long term, such as type2 and will have a risk for heart diseases. It will end up leading to adulthood obesity, which will give serious heart problems, metabolic syndrome, and several types of cancer.</p>

<p> Instead of pushing a more plant-based diet to help reduce the risk of obesity and chronic diseases, pizza, chicken nuggets, and mozzarella sticks are served.  There are predictions that young people will be outlived by their own parents, as a direct result from the food that they consume. This is resulting on more visits to the ICU from younger and younger people in recent years, when before it was more elderly approaching the end of their lives. Many of the children with obesity are bullied and teased more than normal weight kids, they end up suffering from isolation, depression, and low self-esteem.</p>

<p>	Within the states there are various states that do not make any effort to have school require a nutrition program. Only a handful of states actually require it like Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Maine and so on. While there are many states that do have nutrition programs in their states, it is not required, such as in NY, Minnesota, Ohio, Penn, and so on. Only in recent years have more states added standard, regulations, and nutrition education.</p>

<p>	Although the nation is on an unhealthy path, there are various programs that are coming out with ways to stay healthy. These programs give recipes that will improve a healthier diet, show how to balance your meals, and what you should and should not eat.</p>
