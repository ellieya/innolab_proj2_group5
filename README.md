# Plan
Day 1 (Saturday) - Learn as much JavaScript required to produce tabs & look up interesting color palettes.
Day 2 (Sunday) - At around noon-ish, we will decide on our color palette. For the rest of the day, we will each attempt to create a site that looks similar to our plans.
Day 3 (Monday) - We will compare each other's individual work to see what worked & what can be worked on.
Days 3 to 6 (Monday to Thursday) - Continue progress on website. Whenever you don't feel like coding, do research on your content assignment.
Day 6 (Thursday) - Look over each other's work and check any grammatical errors or ways to optimize code.
Day 7 (Friday) - Yaaaay we done (hopefully)
